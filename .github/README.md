# SketchUp Ruby API Stubs

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sketchup-api-stubs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sketchup-api-stubs) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6l5tqoawh44lut66/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thomthom/ruby-api-stubs/branch/master)

Auto-generated stubs for the SketchUp Ruby API. Useful for IDE intellisense and auto-complete.

This is currently a work in progress and it may change a lot in the near future.

The stubs are automatically generated by a YARD template which we will publish in our sketchup-yard-template repository: https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-yard-template

We are experimenting with allowing pull requests to this repository. You can make changes to the `.rb` files in the `lib/sketchup-api-stubs/stubs` folder and send us a pull request.

If you send a pull request, please test the changed by building the documentation first. Make sure you have the nessecary gems installed; `bundle install`. From the location where you clone this repository, run `bundle exec yardoc`.

Guidance on how to set up editors to use the stubs will come.
